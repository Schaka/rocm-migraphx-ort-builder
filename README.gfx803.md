# Polaris / gfx803 variant

Experimental image for Polaris cards -- RX 460, 470, 480, 550, 560, 570, 580,
590, plus the R9 Fury/Nano generation that shares the gfx803 ISA. Built from
`Dockerfile.gfx803` by the manual `gfx803.yml` workflow, entirely separate from
the nightly matrix in the [main README](README.md).

> **This is not a supported configuration.** Officially supported is gfx900 and
> above, i.e. what AMD lists in the ROCm supported-GPU matrix. gfx803 is
> best-effort, has never been tested on hardware by this project, and is slow
> by construction (see [Expectations](#expectations)). Issues against it are
> welcome as reports, not as regressions.

## Why it's a separate image, not another arch in the matrix

ROCm 7 removed Polaris support outright. ROCR-Runtime rejects agents reporting
"legacy" HSA doorbell types 0 and 1, which is exactly what Polaris hardware
reports, so the GPU agent is dropped before it is ever enumerated --
`rocminfo` fails with `HSA_STATUS_ERROR` and `clinfo` reports zero devices. See
[ROCm/clr#269](https://github.com/ROCm/clr/issues/269), where an AMD engineer
root-causes it and publishes a patched ROCR in a
[TheRock fork](https://github.com/lucbruni-amd/TheRock/tree/lb/gfx803-polaris-support).

That patch restores enumeration, but the same commit's build config has to
exclude MIOpen, composable_kernel, hipBLASLt, hipSPARSELt, rocWMMA and
rocprofiler-compute for gfx803 -- which is most of what MIGraphX needs. On
ROCm 7, a Polaris image would enumerate the card and then have nothing to
dispatch convolutions to.

ROCm 6.x has no doorbell check at all. A stock `rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04:6.4.x`
image enumerates a Polaris card as shipped, no runtime patch required, and
MIOpen still works. So this variant pins the last ROCm 6 release rather than
carrying a patched runtime forward. That means it can't be an entry in
`ROCM_ARCH` -- it isn't a different GPU target on the same stack, it's a
different ROCm major, base image and dependency set.

## What gets rebuilt, and why

| Component | Source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rocBLAS | `rocm-6.4.4` tag | Dropped gfx803 from its default `TARGET_LIST` at ROCm 6.0, but the gfx803 Tensile logic (`Logic/asm_full/r9nano/*.yaml`) is still in the tree, so `rmake.py -a gfx803` builds it back. The base image's prebuilt copy has no gfx803 code objects. |
| MIGraphX | `release/rocm-rel-6.4` | Prebuilt for gfx900+ only, same as on the main image. |
| PyTorch | `ROCm/pytorch` `release/2.8` | No gfx803 wheel has ever been published. torchvision and torchaudio are built alongside it. |
| ONNX Runtime | `v1.21.1` | Built against the MIGraphX above. |

**MIOpen is deliberately *not* rebuilt** -- it comes from the base image
untouched. It still carries its `Ellesmere`/`Baffin`/`Polaris10`/`Polaris11` →
`gfx803` device map and its gfx803 asm and Winograd convolution solvers. What
it lacks is a gfx803 `.kdb`, which is the *tuning* database: untuned, not
broken. This is the single component that is dead on ROCm 7 and alive here, and
it's why the 6.x route is viable at all.

## What is switched off

None of these have ever supported gfx8, on any branch:

- **rocMLIR** -- `AmdArchDb.cpp` knows gfx9/gfx10/gfx11/gfx12 only, verified
  identical from `rocm-5.7.0` through `rocm-6.4.0`.
- **composable_kernel** -- floor is gfx908 across the 6.x line (gfx900 on
  `develop`).
- **hipBLASLt** -- gfx90a and newer.

Turning them off in MIGraphX's cmake is necessary but not sufficient: `rbuild`
builds everything `requirements.txt` lists regardless of MIGraphX's own
options, so `composable_kernel` and `rocMLIR` are stripped from that file
before the build runs. Without that they'd still be compiled for gfx803, and
fail.

hipBLASLt can't be excluded at PyTorch build time -- torch 2.8 links it
unconditionally in `cmake/Dependencies.cmake` -- so the final image sets
`TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT=0` to keep GEMMs off a library with no gfx803
kernels.

## Expectations

Untuned MIOpen convolutions, no kernel fusion (no CK, no MLIR), on hardware
with no packed-fp16 and no dot-product instructions. This exists to make a
20-euro card usable, not competitive. For small models it may still beat CPU;
for anything large, measure before believing.

## Versions

| | Pinned to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base | `rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04:6.4.4-complete` | Last ROCm 6 release. `-complete` because MIGraphX needs MIOpen's dev files. |
| Python | 3.12 | Ubuntu 24.04's native interpreter, so no uv overlay is needed here (unlike the main image, whose 26.04 base ships 3.14). |
| PyTorch | `release/2.8` + torchvision `v0.23.0` + torchaudio `v2.8.0` | Matches AMD's own `rocm/onnxruntime:rocm6.4.4_ub24.04_ort1.21_torch2.8.0`. |
| ONNX Runtime | `v1.21.1` | Newest release AMD pairs with ROCm 6.4. Also still has the pre-removal `--use_rocm`/`--rocm_home` flags, unlike the v1.27 the main image builds. |

> **PyTorch 2.8 vs 2.6.** 2.8 is verified against ROCm 6.4.4, not against
> gfx803. The combination actually run on Polaris hardware is torch
> `release/2.6` + torchvision `v0.21.0` + torchaudio `v2.6.0`, by the

## Packages

All namespaced `rocm-gfx803-*` so they can't be confused with the
supported-GPU packages:

- `rocm-gfx803-rocblas-builder:gfx803` -- ROCm with rocBLAS rebuilt for gfx803
- `rocm-gfx803-migraphx-builder:gfx803` -- the above plus from-source MIGraphX
- `rocm-gfx803-torch-builder:gfx803` -- torch, torchvision, torchaudio wheels
- `rocm-gfx803-ort-builder:gfx803` -- ONNX Runtime wheel
- `rocm-gfx803-ort-torch-builder:latest` / `:<YYYYMMDD>` -- the combined image

The first four are build plumbing. Downstream consumers want the last one,
which is the same layout as the main image (`/opt/venv` on `PATH`, `/opt/rocm`
with from-source MIGraphX) plus torchvision and torchaudio.

```dockerfile
ARG BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/<owner>/rocm-gfx803-ort-torch-builder:latest
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}
RUN python3 -c "import onnxruntime as ort; print(ort.get_available_providers())"
```

## Building

Manual only. There is deliberately no schedule: every version above is pinned
to an immutable ref, so a nightly run would rebuild identical inputs.

```
gh workflow run gfx803.yml
```

The chain is `rocblas` → {`migraphx`, `pytorch`} → `ort` → `final`. rocBLAS
comes first because both MIGraphX and PyTorch link it and both need the gfx803
rebuild; MIGraphX and PyTorch are independent and run in parallel.

Each component is individually skippable via the workflow's checkboxes --
rocBLAS in particular only changes when the ROCm version does, so a torch-only
rebuild shouldn't spend hours regenerating Tensile kernels. A skipped
component's downstream jobs reuse whatever it last published. The workflow also
exposes `pytorch-ref` / `torchvision-ref` / `torchaudio-ref` for the 2.6
fallback, and `debug` for a tmate session.

Locally:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.gfx803 -t rocm-gfx803-builder .
```

## Running

Needs `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` passed through, as any ROCm container does:

```
docker run --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video \
    ghcr.io/<owner>/rocm-gfx803-ort-torch-builder:latest \
    python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
```

The image already sets the Polaris runtime environment
(`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=8.0.3`, `ROC_ENABLE_PRE_VEGA=1`,
`TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT=0`); no extra `-e` flags should be needed.

## Host-side caveats

Neither of these can be fixed inside the image:

- **Linux 6.12 and 6.13 are reported to segfault on gfx803** (per the
  gfx803_rocm project). If the stack crashes on an otherwise correct setup,
  check the host kernel before suspecting the image.
- Mining-edition cards often have no display outputs, which is irrelevant for
  compute, but confirm the board is a genuine 8GB Polaris 10 and not a 4GB
  rebadge.

## Credit

The ROCm-6.x-plus-rebuilt-rocBLAS approach, and the specific knowledge of which
knobs Polaris needs, comes from two community projects:

- [robertrosenbusch/gfx803_rocm](https://github.com/robertrosenbusch/gfx803_rocm)
  -- actively maintained, ROCm 6.4, the source of the torch 2.6 hardware
  validation and the kernel-version warning
- [woodrex83/ROCm-For-RX580](https://github.com/woodrex83/ROCm-For-RX580) --
  the earlier ROCm 6.1.2 take

Neither builds MIGraphX or ONNX Runtime; that part is new here and
correspondingly less proven.
